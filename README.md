# Course3Week4Assignment
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

Data needs to be downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
Details about the data can be read from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

This repo contains
  1. run_analysis.R - it is the code file which reads the data files and creates a tidy data set which is written into a data_tidy.csv file
  2. CodeBook.Rmd - detail description of the code written in run_analysis.R 
  3. README.md - it contains the introduction about the repo and the files inside it
  4. data_tidy.txt - this is the output file which is generated using run_analysis.R

for running the run_analysis code, change the directory path to your local directory path where you have copied the data files.
